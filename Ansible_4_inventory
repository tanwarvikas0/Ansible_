An Ansible inventory file is a basically a file that contains a list of servers, group
of servers, or ip addresses that references that hosts

The /etc/ansible/hosts is the default inventory file

# mkdir /home/vikas/plays

# cat myhosts
node1
node2
node3
node4
list all your hosts in the myhosts
inventory file:

]$ ansible all -i myhosts --list-hosts

-i option was used to specify the myhosts inventory file. If you omit the -i option, Ansible will look for hosts in the /etc/ansible/hosts

/etc/hosts,   ## add the hostname in the file of /etc/hosts

################    We can also add these node in the groups like this ###########
$ cat myhosts
[test]
node1
node2
[prod]
node3
node4
