/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg is the default configuration file.

$ ansible --version

two most important sections that you need to define in your Ansible  file are:
1. [defaults]
2. [privilege_escalation]

[defaults] section, here are the most important settings you need to be aware
of:
• inventory → specifies the path of your inventory file.
• remote_user → specifies the user who will connect to the managed hosts
and run the playbooks.
forks → specifies the number of host that ansible can manage/process in
parallel; default is 5.
• host_key_checking → specifies whether you want to turn on/off SSH key
host checking; default is True.
In the [privilege_escalation] section, you can configure the following settings:
• become → specify where to allow/disallow privilege escalation; default is
False.
• become_method → specify the privilege escalation method; default is sudo.
• become_user → specify the user you become through privilege escalation;
default is root.
• become_ask_pass → specify whether to ask or not ask for privilege password; default is False.
